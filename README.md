# PlatformerGD4
Miziziziz's simple platformer ported to Godot 4, made for this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NScngW8vxK8

The controls are admittedly a bit wonky, but it works. 
The collisoins are also a bit weird (only the top collides correctly). I may open an issue about this later.

But it mostly works and I'm tired of working on it lol.
